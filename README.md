# we-love-movies

WeLoveMovies is the back-end capstone project that I completed during my enrollment at the Chegg Skills (Thinkful) coding bootcamp, which I built using Node.js, Knex.js, and Express.js.

This is the server for the WeLoveMovies front-end [repo](https://github.com/ITbanjo/we-love-movies-frontend.git) provided by Chegg Skills.
